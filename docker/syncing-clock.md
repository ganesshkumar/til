By default docker container’s will sync their time with the local system time but the default timezone is “UTC”. If you are using Date or Time in your application, you have to manually set the timezone for the container. One easy way to do so is using the environmental variable -e "TZ=Asia/Kolkata".

But sometimes, the container time will deviate a little from the local system time. In that case, OS X, linux and unix have ‘/etc/localtime’ file by default. One can mount this file as a read-only file inside the container. -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro.

Please post below, if you find any other issues related to time within docker container.
